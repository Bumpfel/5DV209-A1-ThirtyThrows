        You get six dice to roll.\n
        A game consists of 10 rounds. In each round you can roll the dice three times. You can choose to hold a die by clicking on it (it will turn grey to indicate its status).\n
        \n
        Scoring\n
        After a round is finished, you have to choose a score. A score is consumed once chosen, meaning you can only choose a particular score once per game.\n
        There are ten score choices: Low, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, and Twelve. \n
        Each die may only be counted once.\n
        Low is counted a little different than the others: All dice with a value of three or lower counts towards your points.\n
        For the other choices: all dice that can be combined to sum up to the exact score choice yields points. \n
        E.g. a roll of 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 2 would yield 18 points for the choice NINE since 5 + 4, and 6 + 3 both sums up to 9 points. \n
        \n
        The game automatically calculates the points for the chosen score. The score that yields the most points will automatically be selected after each round (but it does not mean it\'s always the best choice).\n
        If two or more score choices yields the same amount of points, the highest score choice will be selected.\n
        \n
        You can see which score choices you have left by expanding the drop down list during a round, or if you click to view the scoreboard by clicking the \"Total points\" in the bottom left corner.\n
