    <!-- How to play -->
    <string name="how_to_play_text">
        You get six dice to roll.\nA game consists of 10 rounds. In each round you can roll the dice three times. You can choose to hold a die by clicking on it (it will turn grey to indicate its status).\n\nScoring\nEach die may only be counted once.\nAfter a round is finished, you have to choose a score. A score choice is consumed once chosen, meaning you can only choose a particular score once per game.\nThere are ten different scores choices: Low, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, and Twelve. \nLow is counted a little different than the others: All dice with a value of three or lower counts towards your points.\nFor the other choices: all dice that can be used (in combination with other dice or by itself) to sum up to the exact score choice yields points. \nE.g. a roll of 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 2 would yield 18 points for the choice NINE since 5 + 4, and 6 + 3 both sums up to 9 points. \n\nThe game automatically calculates the points for the chosen score. The score choice that yields the most points will automatically be selected after each round (but it does not mean it\'s always the best choice).\nIf two or more score choices yields the same amount of points, the highest score choice will be selected.\nThe game will use the first combinations found. There might be alternative combinations, but the total points will always be the same nevertheless.\n\nYou can see which score choices you have left by expanding the drop down list during a round. You can also click on \"Total points\" in the bottom left corner to view the current score board.\n
